  <p>The <strong>Fibonacci numbers</strong> (denoted <em><span class="math-tex">\(F_{n}\)</span></em>) form a sequence where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...</p> 
  <p><span class="math-tex">\(F_{n} = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} \)</span> , and <span class="math-tex">\(F_0 = 0, F_1 = 1\)</span></p> 
  <p>The Fibonacci numbers were used to illustrate the growth of an idealized rabbit population that live and reproduce according to the following rules: </p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>the initial population is a pair of baby rabbits (a female + a male)</li> 
   <li>rabbits become adults at the age of one month and after another month give birth to a new pair of baby rabbits</li> 
   <li>these rabbits are immortal</li> 
   <li>a pair of adult rabbits always gives birth to one new pair (a female + a male) a month</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>The Fibonacci numbers tell the number of rabbit pairs after <em>n</em> months, meaning that after 6 months there will be 8 pairs of rabbits: <span class="math-tex">\(F_6 = 8\)</span>.</p> 
  <p>Finish the template of a recursive function that finds how many pairs of rabbits there will be after <em>n </em>months (the <em>n</em>th Fibonacci number). Here, you'll need to make multiple recursive calls inside the function! </p> 
  <p>You do NOT need to take input or call this function! </p>
