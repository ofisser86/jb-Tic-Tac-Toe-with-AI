<h2>Recursive multiplication</h2>

  <p>Imagine that suddenly all machines have gone insane and simple multiplication is not working for natural numbers anymore. Let's write a new function for this task recursively!</p> 
  <p>It's known that "<em>a</em> times <em>b"</em> is the same thing as "<em>a</em> plus itself<em> b</em> times". So we can rewrite the expression in the following way:</p> 
  <p><em><span class="math-tex">\(a*b = a + a+ a + a + ... + a\)</span></em></p> 
  <p>We need to reduce this problem to a smaller one with the recursive step, and then stop recursion with the base step.</p> 
  <p>Modify the template code below into a working function that takes two positive integers as its input and returns their product.</p>
